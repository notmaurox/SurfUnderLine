# SurfUnderLine
Database project to help surfers better understand and predict surf conditions as completed for Principals of Database Systems class

## database_design_documentation.pdf

This document describes the design and implementation of a relational database which aims to record metrics involved in predicting surf conditions from popular surf resource Surfline.com. Surfers sometimes find themselves disagreeing with the predictions Surfline makes about surf quality, these moments of disagreement provide an opportunity to study gaps in Surfline’s knowledge. Surfers know their local beaches best and a collection of surfers from the same area know their beaches even better. The goal of this project was to develop a system for tracking surf metrics, saving historical Surfline predictions, and recording surfer’s feedback on how good those predictions were.


Within the pages of this document, readers will find a through explanation of the requirements, design, and implementation of the system described above. Extra detail will be provided on the goals of the system, the motivating factors behind choices made in the design of the system, and the way in which the system was implemented. This document touches on the processes of conceptual design, via descriptions of entities and relationships, and logical design, via the presentation of E/R diagrams. Readers will also find descriptions of the features and intended capabilities of this system. A later section will discuss the implementation of this system as a web app via the Django framework.
